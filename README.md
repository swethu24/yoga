Hey ! 
I have here created a simple webpage for the booking of yoga classes. This webpage gets the details from the user and validates if the user is within the age limit and 
asks them to confirm the slot booking.
For this application, I have used simple HTML ans some styling using CSS at my frontend and PHP as my Backend language . I have created a database in the XAMPP phpmyadmin 
block and used it for my application.
